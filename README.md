__**Junk It**__ is still a work in progress. The mod is currently in a beta state and may have bugs.

# Junk It

This is a spiritual successor for the "Mark As Junk" mod. The author of mark as junk had a great idea but there has not been any updates to it since it's first release. 

It was easy to see where they were headed with the mod, though the original is simple and only marks items with a "Junk" keyword and only while viewing the "Inventory" menu. This mod is a bit more advanced and allows marking items in any Menu that has an item list. 

In addition to marking items as "Junk" there are several new utilities added to help with inventory management.

## Features

- Mark items as "Junk" in any menu that has an item list using the "Mark As Junk" configurable hotkey.
- Items marked as "Junk" will have a "Junk" icon displayed next to them.
- Junk items now have their sub type set to "Junk" so that it can easily be sorted and filtered.
- There is now a "Transfer" hotkey that can be configured in the MCM which changes it's functionality depending on which menu is open.
- The "Transfer" hotkey will bulk sell all junk items while viewing the the "Barter" menu.
- If viewing a container or trading with a follower, the "Transfer" hotkey will move all junk items to the container or follower.
- Priority settings are available for both Bulk Sell and Transfer functions. The priority options are as follows:
    - Weight: High to Low
    - Weight: Low to High
    - Value: High to Low
    - Value: Low to High
    - ValueWeight: High to Low
    - ValueWeight: Low to High
- Bulk Sell and Transfer functions are limited to Gold Amount/Weight Capacity.
- Junk items that are Equipped or Favorited will not show as "junk" and will be ignored by the Bulk Sell and Transfer functions.
    - Prevents accidental selling/transfer of items that are currently in use.
